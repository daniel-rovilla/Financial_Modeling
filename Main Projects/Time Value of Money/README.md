This project focuses on TVM, an enterprise is developing some products and the model seeks to calculate the cash flows to determine the Net Present Value of the company. <br>
Files used:
- Project - TVM.ipynb

After developing the first model, we added some extensions to have a deeper analysis of the original model.<br>
Files used:
- Adding MC Simulation to TVM Project.ipynb
- Adding Sensitivity to TVM Project.ipynb

> Note: With the last Conda update, the library `SensitivityAnalyzer` from the package `sensitivity`, is having some issues.
This will affect the "Adding Sensitivity to TVM Project" notebook.
Had notified the package developer about this, should be fixed soon.
