    "- The WACC for the company is 15% and it has 1 million shares outstanding. The company has \\\\$5 million in debt and \\\\$1 million in cash.\n",
    "- What is the enterprise value of the stock at year 4 before Google acquires the company? What about the enterprise value today? What is the price of the stock today?\n",

    "A pharmaceutical company developed a new drug and has 4 years to sell it before the patent expires. It forms a new company to manufacture and sell the drug. After 4 years, the company will be sold to someone that wants to continue manufacturing at the lower price. The company is just about to pay a dividend. <br>\n",
    "- The new company pays a dividend of \\\\$1 per share each year for years 0 to 3, before selling it for \\\\$30 million in year 4.\n",
