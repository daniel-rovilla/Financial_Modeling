## Description of the Projects

### Combining Excel and Python
Starts with using pandas to import, write and export Excel documents.
Files used:
    - Write Excel with Pandas.ipynb
    - MSFT Financials.xls

Next level will be to control Excel with the library `xlwings`. This powerful
library allows us to control Excel from Python without having to export each
command intended.
Files used:
    - Combining Excel and Python.ipynb
    - xlwings.xlsx

Continuing with `xlwings`, a new model where VBA would be required, a
Monte Carlo simulation written in Python and executed instantly in Excel
Files used:
    - Excel Monte Carlo.ipynb
    - Dynamic Salary Retirement Model with Monte Carlo.xlsx
 > Note: Some extra analysis steps are already done in the Excel file, the point
 of this Jupyter Notebook is to show how Python can run a Monte Carlo simulation
 directly in Excel
