# Financial Modeling

Different models which seek to build an abstract representation of a real world financial situation. <br>
There are different mathematical models designed to represent the performance of a financial asset or portfolio, project, or any other investment. <br>
Models are divided in two broader categories:
- Main Projects
- Small Projects

The "small projects" are the building blocks to develop a "main project" where a more complex and specific situation is being solved.
